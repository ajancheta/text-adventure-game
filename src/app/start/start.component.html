<p>{{newPlayer}}, you are at your favorite surfing spot, Sunset Beach!

  Before you can paddle in the TURTLES ATTACK!  Gigantic sea turtles that have had enough of humanity's plastic waste have decided to take the beach back! They are eating a surfer right in front of you.

  Just then a turtle approaches you with a barrel of radioactive waste, he says "I am Tweedle, I will kill you or you can join me. Choose human!"

  What do you do?
